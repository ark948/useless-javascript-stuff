JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:l
    Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
    Writing into the HTML output using document.write(). 
    Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
    Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML:


What is Good?
let and const have block scope.
let and const can not be redeclared.
let and const must be declared before use.
let and const does not bind to this.
let and const are not hoisted.

What is Not Good?
var does not have to be declared.
var is hoisted.
var binds to this.

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!
